# Wakey's fabulous Kubernetes Dev Talk 

These are the Kubernetes config files that accompany my Kubernetes Dev Talk of 21/07/2021.

The files should work on any Kubernetes installation, however I have run them on a local Docker Desktop cluster and a cluster on CGP. 
The files are organised by directory for the intended targets.
